# inventory_webpage
Inventory management webpage using Django and Oracle database

My database management project is about material management. I have chosen a retail management project and have created the tables that are 3NF normalized and implemented a web app to manage a warehouse.

The project is implemented using docker containers. I have used the Python linux image (python:3.10-bullseye) and implemented in django framework. The frontend is a dynamic web page with a clean design implemented using HTMl, CSS, JS & Bootstrap framework.
